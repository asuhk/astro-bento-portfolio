During our Startup Management university course, my team of five and I conceptualized and presented a unique startup pitch for a Wireless Charging Router.

The concept was inspired by ongoing research in Japanese universities on emerging wireless charging technology, which operates through a central hub, similar to a Wi-Fi router. This router would not only provide internet connectivity but also charge multiple devices wirelessly, with the potential to scale for use in larger domains such as stations, airports, and malls.

To transform a rough idea into a fully developed pitch, our team conducted extensive research into the technology, identified potential applications and target markets, analyzed market trends, and calculated operational and implementation costs.

To further bring this concept to life, I leveraged my 3D modeling skills to create a digital render of the router prototype using Blender.

For the final phase of the project, our team prepared a startup pitch presentation, where I took on the role of the spokesperson and presented our idea to university professors and industry professionals in a virtual startup pitch environment.

Our idea received the highest number of virtual investments, securing $11 million from 11 interested parties.
