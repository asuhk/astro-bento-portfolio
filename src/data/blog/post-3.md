This university project was an individual project part of the _GUI Design and Web Optimization_ module. The goal was to design a website model in Figma, with CSS and code compatibility, for a travel agency.  

I created a concept for a travel agency called *Shamian*, which offered affordably priced luxury tours for its customers.
Its target audience was identified as late 20s to early 40s travel enthusiasts who want to visit enigmatic locations with personalized tours and a luxurious ambiance without having to spend extravagantly.  

Hence, I designed a contemporary and bright UI layout with modern UI design elements. Minimalist design choices were implemented for elements such as buttons, search bars, menus, and miscellaneous UI components. However, bright and vivid landscapes were sprawled throughout the website as wallpapers, and occasional warm colors like oranges and yellows were incorporated to maintain the websiteâ€™s vibrant look.
